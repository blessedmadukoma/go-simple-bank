# Simple Bank Project

## Project by TechSchool Tutorial

### Requirements: <br/>
 1. Create and manage account
   - Owner, balance, currency
 2. Record all balance changes
   - Creat an account entry for each change
 3. Money transfer transaction
   - Perform money transfer between 2 accounts consistently within a transaction (meaning if a transfer doesn't go through, both the debit and the credit should not occur - and vice versa i.e. both accounts are updated successfully!)
